addrsolver3.c
	- one event source for each query
	- one resolver for each query
	- NOT prone to input overload
	- useful for memory leak testing

addrsolver2.c
	- one event source across queries
	- one resolver for each query
	- NOT prone to input overload
	- useful for memory leak testing

addrsolver.c
	- one event source across queries
	- one resolver across queries
	- NOT prone to input overload
	- useful for memory leak testing

srvsolver2.c
	- query SRV records "almost" asynchronously
	- NOT prone to input overload
	- useful for memory leak testing

ruli-host.c
	- query address records "almost" asynchronously
	- NOT prone to input overload
	- useful for ruli_host testing (asynchronous, 
          address-family-agnostic layer)

hostsolver.c
	- translates hostnames to addresses asynchronously
	- prone to input overload
	- uses output queue
	- useful for testing asynchronous resolver behavior

srvsolver.c
	- query SRV records asynchronously
	- prone to input overload
	- useful for testing asynchronous SRV behavior

resolve.c
	- perform an arbitrary query synchronously
	- can resubmit a query mutiple times
	- doesn't parse the answer
	- useful for very basic query submission testing

syncsolver.c
	- query SRV records synchronously
	- useful for testing synchronous API

list.c
	- test for ruli_list_t data structures

stdin_domains.c
	- auxiliar functions to monitor stdin for input

stdout_srv_list.c
	- auxiliar function to output SRV records

ipv6.c
	- test for IPv6 helper functions
