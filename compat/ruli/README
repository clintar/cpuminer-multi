INTRODUCTION

	RULI stands for Resolver User Layer Interface. It's a library
	built on top of an asynchronous DNS stub resolver. RULI
	provides an easy-to-use interface for querying DNS SRV
	resource records. The goal is to promote the wide deployment
	of SRV-cognizant client programs. RULI aims to fully support
	SRV-related standards.

PLATFORMS

        RULI main development is performed under Debian GNU/Linux.
        Efforts are made to keep the library portable to
        major POSIX systems, such as Solaris and FreeBSD.

        If you need assistance to port RULI to your system,
        please feel free to contact me.

REQUIREMENTS

	RULI depends on Liboop (0.9 or higher), available at:

	http://download.ofb.net/liboop/

	http://directory.fsf.org/libs/c/liboop.html

	http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/libo/liboop/liboop_1.0.orig.tar.gz

	http://liboop.org/

BUILD AND INSTALL

	1. Install Liboop on your system

	2. Compile and install RULI library

		cd ruli/src

		# Point OOP_BASE_DIR to the location of
		# Liboop on your system, then run 'make build'

		make OOP_BASE_DIR=/usr/local/oop build

		# Optionally, strip the objects

		make strip

	    	# Point INSTALL_BASE_DIR to location where you want
		# to install RULI library, then run 'make install'

		make INSTALL_BASE_DIR=/usr/local/ruli install

	3. Tell the dynamic loader about RULI

		# Add INSTALL_BASE_DIR/lib path to
		# /etc/ld.so.conf

		ldconfig

	4. Compile and install RULI sample programs (optional)

		cd ruli/sample

		# Point OOP_BASE_DIR to the location of
		# Liboop on your system, then run 'make build'

		make OOP_BASE_DIR=/usr/local/oop build

		# Optionally, strip the objects

		make strip

	    	# Point INSTALL_BASE_DIR to location where you want
		# to install RULI sample programs, then run 'make install'

		make INSTALL_BASE_DIR=/usr/local/ruli install

	5. Compile and install RULI testing tools (optional)

		cd ruli/tools

		# Point OOP_BASE_DIR to the location of
		# Liboop on your system, then run 'make build'

		make OOP_BASE_DIR=/usr/local/oop build

		# Optionally, strip the objects

		make strip

	    	# Point INSTALL_BASE_DIR to location where you want
		# to install RULI testing tools, then run 'make install'

		make INSTALL_BASE_DIR=/usr/local/ruli install

SAMPLE PROGRAMS

	Use the programs in 'sample' directory to test RULI. They are
	also good introductory examples of how to use RULI APIs.

	The sync_srvsearch program uses the synchronous API. This is an
	example session:

	$ echo _smtp._tcp.domain.tld | ./sync_srvsearch
	_smtp._tcp.domain.tld target=phantom.domain.tld. priority=5 weight=0 port=25 addresses=IPv4/1.2.3.4
	_smtp._tcp.domain.tld target=sitemail.host.tld. priority=10 weight=0 port=25 addresses=IPv4/4.3.2.1

	The srvsearch program uses the asynchronous API. This is
	an example session:

	$ echo _smtp._tcp.domain.tld | ./srvsearch
	_smtp._tcp.domain.tld target=phantom.domain.tld. priority=5 weight=0 port=25 addresses=IPv4/1.2.3.4
	_smtp._tcp.domain.tld target=sitemail.host.tld. priority=10 weight=0 port=25 addresses=IPv4/4.3.2.1

	The ruli-getaddrinfo uses the the getaddrinfo() interface
        to lookup SRV records, based on ruliwrap from
        http://weinholt.se/hacks/. This is an usage example:

	$ echo _telnet._tcp.bogus.tld | ./ruli-getaddrinfo
	_telnet._tcp.bogus.tld canon=mud.bogus.tld. port=6789 IPv4/5.6.7.8
